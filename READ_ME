[RISK Board Game]

> This is a simulation of the board game RISK: The World Domination Game. Made entirely in C++, and executed via the command terminal of your compiler. 

> This was an exercise in OOP and control flow, as well as solidifying knowledge of C++ and its libraries. It is also a a platform to add other features.

> In order to play, download C++ files and .map resources. Run in compiler and input appropriate commands via keyboard. Valid commands will be displayed in the console.

> TODO: - Add user interface
        - Log all commands, actions, results, etc. Export game log at completion of game.
        - Use JS to allow players to connect via WebSockets

> Current Limitations: lack of GUI makes testing labour intensive and time consuming.
